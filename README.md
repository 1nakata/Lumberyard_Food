# Lumberyard Food Hall

## Description
This project is a Small Visualization of a space to be made in Lumberyard.
I hope to use this to make a detailed Environment model of an Actual space called Lumberyard Food Hall in Pullman.

This is to help me learn to make a small interactive project in Lumberyard covering all the Art and Design of 3D Models to Level Layout and Programming basic interactions.

# How to setup this project?

You need to use the same folder name as the github name. In this case **'Lumberyard_Food'** must be used as the name when you create a new project in Lumberyard Projects
